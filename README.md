Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

    For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

    Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
    I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
    I included a textarea  of my resume
    I included a recent image placeholder for my photo that i will add later.
    The projects presented in the My skills section include a couple of image of the skills placeholder  that will be added to as I complete more applications in the bootcamp and on my own.
    The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
    The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
    I also included some on hover effects  on the page.
